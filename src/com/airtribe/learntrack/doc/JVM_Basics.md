**What is JDK, JRE, JVM ?**

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)** :- A software development kit used to develop Java applications. It includes the JRE and development tools like the Java compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities.


- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** :- A software package that provides the necessary libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications. It is intended for end-users and does not include development tools.


- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** :- An abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code for execution on the host system.


**What is bytecode ?**

Bytecode is an intermediate representation of a Java program that is generated after the source code is compiled by the Java compiler (javac). It is a low-level, platform-independent code that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Bytecode is stored in .class files and allows Java programs to be portable across different operating systems and hardware platforms, as the JVM on each platform can interpret and execute the same bytecode.


**What does “write once, run anywhere” mean ?**

"Write once, run anywhere" (WORA) is a key principle of Java programming that emphasizes the platform independence of Java applications. It means that a Java program can be written and compiled on one platform (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) and then run on any other platform that has a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without requiring any modifications to the code.
